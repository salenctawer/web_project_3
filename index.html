                                        <li class="table__paragraph">Thankfully, not only is Maine home to the very first European settlers on US territory in the era of Vikings, 
                                            but is also home to L.L. Bean, which is a great company to grab a super sturdy backpack from for your 3-month expedition. </li>

                                the best outdoor shoe company in the history of the world proudly hails from this state. Cycle by the Timberland headquarters in Stratham, 
                                and pick up a pair of rugged, waterproof boots to keep your feet dry. Fitting for unpredictable weather you may be confronted by while passing through
